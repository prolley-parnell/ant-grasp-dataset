No,☑️ - Manipulated or Pinched - No Grasp,No,"Not Synchronised Video. At 1:26, an ant walks up to the pile of seeds, first contacting a dandelion seed with its antennae then probing a lump of pollen. This ant touches the lump of pollen with its mandible tips and forelegs, manipulating the object, and using the forelegs to pull the lump towards the ants body. The ant does this without pinching the pollen lump with its mandibles. The ant then moves to a large flat seed. The ant stands on the seed with its forelegs, the left and right midlegs are stood on the pollen lump and an oat seed respectively. The ant follows the thin edge of the flat seed using its mandibles and manipulating that seed with its forelegs. Then the ant moves to sense an oat, and a mustard seed, walking over the two before walking away.","Dandelion seed, Large Seed, Pollen Lump",Yes,26,2024/07/25 15:28 (GMT+1)
No,✅ - Grasped + Dropped,No,"Not Synchronised Video. At 0:02, an ant senses a pollen lump making localised frequent taps with the antennae. The ant moves to pinch the object with its mandibles and uses its forelegs to pull the pollen lump towards its body. The mandibles appear to be vibrating against the pollen lump in between the inner edges of the mandibles. The ant makes multiple pinching attempts on this pollen lump but does not grasp it. The ant then moves to sense a dandelion seed with its antennae, and uses its legs to pull a different dandelion seed away from the first. The ant rotates the seed and its body so the two are more aligned and rotates its head to fit the mandibles around the dandelion seed. The ant lifts this dandelion seed with it held in the mandibles but does not carry the seed away, and continues pinching up the length of the seed. The ant moves on to sense an oat seed, manipulating it briefly, then crawls over and touches the open mandibles to a mustard seed but walks off without grasping.","Dandelion seed, Large Seed, Mustard Seed, Pollen Lump",Yes,28,2024/07/25 15:28 (GMT+1)
No,✅ - Grasped + Dropped,No,"Not Synchronised Video. At 0:36, the ant walks up to a pollen lump and taps it with tho antennae and touches the lump with its forelegs in multiple locations, then the ant moves onto a dandelion seed that it pulls using the forelegs, and grips using the mandibles, to then pick up the seed. Using its forelegs to hold the seed while it readjusts the grip the mandibles, the ant moves the mandibles up towards the widest end of the seed. The ant then continues moving the mandibles along the seed surface, back down to the smaller tip. The ant puts the dandelion seed down, and senses the pile of seeds in a wide range with the antennae and walks away without manipulating any other seeds.",Dandelion seed,Yes,29,2024/07/25 15:28 (GMT+1)
No,✅ - Grasped + Dropped,No,"Not Synchronised Video. At 0:05, a large ant enters the scene, tapping over the pile of seeds in a wide range with the tips of the antennae. The ant walks around the pile of seeds, until it reaches a dandelion seed. At this point, the search becomes more localised over a small area around the seed. The ant makes contact with the antennae on the dandelion seed then uses its forelegs to pull and manipulate the seed. The ant pinches with the mandibles and lifts the seed off the ground while the forelegs remain in contact with the seed. The mandible pinch releases and the and continues to pinch the dandelion seed in other locations, continuing to contact the seed with rapid tapping movements the whole time.

At 0:15 another ant senses a dandelion seed with its antennae then walks away without manipulating anything. At 0:22, that same ant walks back through the outer edge of the scene walking over some dandelion seeds. At 0:31, an ant walks up to a dandelion seed and senses it with the antennae then senses a large flat seed with the antennae, and walking over a dandelion seed. This ant manipulates the dandelion seed using its forelegs and rotates the seed to align it with the mandibles. This ant touches the seed with its mandibles but does not grip the seed. It walks to another dandelion seed that it senses with the antennae and in a short period of time, manipulates with the forelegs, pinches with the mandibles multiple times. This ant also appears to use the right midleg to manipulate or hold this seed. The ant searches around the seed in this manner for a number of seconds until it grips the seed using its mandibles, cleans the antennae then walks out of view.",Dandelion seed,Yes,35,2024/07/25 15:28 (GMT+1)
No,☑️ - Manipulated or Pinched - No Grasp,No,"Not Synchronised Video. At 0:17, an ant walks over the pile of seeds. At 0:18, a smaller ant approaches a mustard seed and senses it using the antennae, sensing other seeds in the pile. The range of antennal movement becomes a lot smaller as it senses a dandelion seed and moves the mandibles to the antennae tips. Then the ant uses its legs to manipulate the seed, rotating the seed along its axis as it pulls the seed towards its body. The ant grips multiple times along the seed surface then picks the seed up in its mandibles, curving the abdomen close to the ground as it does. The ant regrasps and continues to manipulate the seed out of frame, but does not grip this seed at any future point. This ant walks back to the seed pile and touches different seeds with the antennae in a wide search area. The ant finds another dandelion seed and approaches it with widening mandibles, but does not pinch it.

It does sense the large grass seed then demonstrates grooming behaviour before walking away. Other ants walk in and out of the scene. ",Dandelion seed,Yes,0,2024/07/25 16:30 (GMT+1)
No,❌ - Sensed - Not Manipulated,No,"Not Synchronised Video. A small ant walks into the scene, cleans the forelegs and antenna then senses a dandelion seed up and down but does not grasp. The ant also senses a grass seed and other seeds in the pile but walks away without grasping.",Dandelion seed,Yes,1,2024/07/25 16:30 (GMT+1)
No,☑️ - Manipulated or Pinched - No Grasp,No,"Not Synchronised Video. At the start of the video, an ant senses a grass seed. The researcher adjusts the pile of seeds using tweezers to move them into centre frame. At 0:28 an ant walks through the scene. At 1:16 an ant manipulates with its forelegs and pinches a Nyjer seed. The ant moves over a grass seed then cleans the forelegs and antennae. The ant then senses a dandelion seed before walking away.",Nyjer,Yes,3,2024/07/25 16:30 (GMT+1)
No,☑️ - Manipulated or Pinched - No Grasp,No,"Not Synchronised Video. Three ants walk in at 0:39, 1:01 and 1:08 respectively and leave with minimal interaction. The ant of interest enters at 1:10, where it senses and manipulates a Nyjer seed, using its legs and mandibles. That ant also senses a grass seed then walks away.",Nyjer,Yes,4,2024/07/25 16:30 (GMT+1)
No,☑️ - Manipulated or Pinched - No Grasp,No,"Not Synchronised Video. The ant of interest enters view at 1:19, sensing the ground with the antennae then sensing a Nyjer seed, but this action is not visible in all frames. The ant moves to sense and manipulate a lump of pollen but does not pinch it. It senses a large grass seed, moving the mandibles along its edge and manipulates the seed with its legs briefly. Then the ant grooms its antennae before sensing the grass seed for a short time longer then walks away.",Nyjer,Yes,5,2024/07/25 16:30 (GMT+1)
No,☑️ - Manipulated or Pinched - No Grasp,No,"Not Synchronised Video. One ant in the video, it approaches the seed, senses it using its antennae and manipulates it using its forelegs causing the seed to move. The ant touches its mandibles to the seed but does not pinch. The ant leaves without attempting to grasp.",Oat,Yes,12,2024/07/25 15:28 (GMT+1)
No,✅✅ - Grasped and Carried Away,No,"Not Synchronised Video. At 0:03, a large ant walks into the scene and taps different dandelion seeds with its antennae, then taps a mustard seed. It uses its forelegs to pull at the mustard seed and makes contact with it using the mandibles, while continuing to tap it with the antennae. This ant walks away without grasping, and walks over the pile of seeds to another dandelion seed that it senses using the antennae and touches with the mandible tips but then walks away. When the ant stops sensing the seed, the range of antennal motion widens and it senses the ground. At 0:10, a smaller ant walks to the pile of seeds and senses a large flat seed with its antennae then a dandelion seed. It opens its mandibles and touches them to the seed, pinching, and using the forelegs to manipulate the seed. The ant moves its mandibles up to the wider end of the seed then continues to rotate then manipulate the seed tracing with the mandibles back towards the thinner tip of the seed. The ant falls over while manipulating the object. Then the ant uses its legs to raise the seed and out of view of the camera grips it in the mandibles then carries the seed away.",Dandelion seed,Yes,33,2024/07/25 15:28 (GMT+1)
