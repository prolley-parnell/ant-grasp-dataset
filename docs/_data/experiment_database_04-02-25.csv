Other ants walk through and interact with the seed by sensing it using antennae then walking away. The ant makes multiple pinches on the nyjer seed with the mandibles, and in the background, a dandelion seed is manipulated and removed however this interaction is not in focus of the cameras. There are multiple ants sensing and manipulating the nyjer seed simultaneously. An ant walks through the scene carrying another seed, interacts with the ant sensing the nyjer seed then leaves, then returns a number of seconds later and re-grasps this other seed in the centre of the field of focus of this video.

The ant scans along the seed and senses using its mandibles, the ant also manipulates the seed using its forelegs. Another ant approaches the seed and senses it at the same time but moves away and senses another seed in the scene instead. The ant initially sensing the seed moves to eat a substance on the ground of the arena. Another ant approaches and the two ants touch antennae, and the first ant then exhibits cleaning behaviours, moving the forelegs along the antennae. This ant then returns to sense the nyjer seed and make some grasp attempts while lifting the seed using its forelegs. Another ant joins to sense and manipulate the seed but walks away without grasping. The ant remaining on the seed makes several grasp attempts, moving away at approximately 2:00. The full video contains multiple ants sensing and attempting to grasp two different seeds in the camera views, but no ants successfully grasp or lift either seed. 2:44 to 3:02, and 3:27 to 3:44 show good examples of the scanning behaviour that occurs when an ant is searching for a grasp.","Nyjer, Oat"
