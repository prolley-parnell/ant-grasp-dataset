The videos are separated into 4 categories based on the observed behaviour of interest. In the context 
of recording, we were most interested in how the ants approached and sensed an object before grasping it and the influence 
of the sensing behaviour on the likelihood of grasp success. Therefore, we organised the videos into the following categories:

- ✅✅ Grasped and carried away
- ✅ Grasped and dropped
- ☑️ Manipulated or pinched but not grasped
- ❌ Sensed but not manipulated
